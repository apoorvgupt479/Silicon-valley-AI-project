<div><p>Note: Machine Learning, UAV Spy and Surveillance software

	Machine learning and AI are bleeding edge technologies. We have to harness the power of machine learning and develop applications around it. Capitalising on the work done ie building algorithms on machine learning, I would catapult JavaScript taught to me by WhiteHat Jr. and extend its power developing application combining machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. I searched open-source machine learning algorithms and found TensorFlow a suitable candidate to work with images and sounds. Simple tasks of differentiating two or more classes of objects can be performed by machine learning in real time. These classes can be images or sound inputs into the algorithms. These classes are called models which train the TensorFlow ML algorithms. The outputs would be indicated by probability meters and can signal differentiating in real-time to alert or play characteristics sounds or images. JavaScript can also alert other websites or mobile devices and keep a log and archives.
	I am creating models for machine learning using TensorFlow. These models will utilise images of military trucks captured through UAV drones in real-time and differentiate from civilian traffic. This will help in assessing congregation of military vehicles along international borders during tension escalations as well as in peace-time surveillance.
	I have utilised boilerplate yarn project using JavaScript the details of which are on tensorflow.org. I have created HTML to input images and use TensorFlow JavaScript locally giving probabilities in a simple format.
	Further applications of my project would include and would not be limited to the following:
	1) Medical use- interpreting ECGs, echocardiograms, pathology slides, radiological images of digital X rays, CTs MRIs and nuclear scans, creating software for electronic stethoscopes and other diagnostic equipment.
	2) Remote sensing use- finding topographical features, weather conditions, detecting stealth aircrafts using laser turbulence images.
	3) Classifications of plants and animals - taxonomy
	4) Forensic studies - identifying criminal patterns, weapons used, fingerprinting, etc.
	5) Copyrights - detecting privacy/ copyright intrusions in new melodies
